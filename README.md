## Hello! 👋

I am a recent Computer Science and Engineering graduate. I specialize in all things data, and am searching for a position as a data engineer or scientist. I code in Python, SQL, Java, Go, Haskell, Scala and many others, and I'm always open to new challenges! Some of my hobbies include watercolour painting, baking, quantum computing(I did a minor in it as part of my Bachelor's) and learning new languages.
